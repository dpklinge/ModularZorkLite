You stand in a grand stone room with a vaulted ceiling. The room is unadorned but for a large rug covering the cold floor. To the south is an aggressive following enemy and a piece of armor; to the west is a stationary aggressive enemy. To the southeast, there is a neutral stationary and neutral following actor. To the east is a good weapon, and beyond that, a place to die quickly. North is a better test dummy.","actorsPresent":["TestDummy"],"itemsPresent":["BaseDagger","StartRoomRock","RugStartRoom"]}
